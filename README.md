# COS200_Final
Programing 2 final project - Learning GHPython

There's two parts:

COS200_GHP_Metal_Plate.py produces a hammered copper sheet from a reference curve.

While working on it, I got the idea to make a weave generator. So, with what I learned from COS200_GHP_Metal_Plate.py, I attempted COS200_GHP_Weave_Generator.py

I managed to get COS200_GHP_Weave_Generator.py working, it takes a surface and creates a knit-like geometry through it.

The remaining files are Rhino (.3dm) and Grasshopper (.gh) files.
